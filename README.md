{"text" : "A plugin's Content-Types can be extended in 2 ways: using the programmatic interface within strapi-server.js|ts and by overriding the content-types schemas.

The final schema of the content-types depends on the following loading order:
1. the content-types of the original plugin,
2 .the content-types overridden by the declarations in the schema defined in ./src/extensions/plugin-name/content-types/content-type-name/schema.json
3. the content-types declarations in the content-types key exported from strapi-server.js|ts
4. the content-types declarations in the register() function of the Strapi application
To overwrite a plugin's content-types:

(optional) Create the ./src/extensions folder at the root of the app, if the folder does not already exist.
Create a subfolder with the same name as the plugin to be extended.
Create a content-types subfolder.
Inside the content-types subfolder, create another subfolder with the same singularName as the content-type to overwrite.
Inside this content-types/name-of-content-type subfolder, define the new schema for the content-type in a schema.json file (see schema documentation).
(optional) Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each content-type to overwrite.
```

## Make your own plugin 

```bash 
# https://github.com/strapi/sdk-plugin
# https://github.com/PaulBratslavsky/strapi-plugin-yt-clips

npx @strapi/sdk-plugin@latest init my-plugin

```

## Creating the comments api route

```bash
# 1. Generate the comments content type
npx strapi generate

# choose content-types it will populate this and rest of controller, service etc..
src/api/comment/content-types/comment/schema.json

# after this, please update the type definition of the new content-types if not vscode will complain 
npx strapi ts:generate-types # types/generated 

# to check everything is good 
npx strapi content-types:list

# when mapping relations, remember to check if want the relationship to be bidirectional, if yes you need to add to both side of the model 

# in discussion schema.json 
"author": {
  "type": "relation",
  "relation": "many-to-one",
  "target": "plugin::users-permissions.user",
  "inversedBy": "discussions"
}

# in plugin user-permission extension  / strapi-server.ts 
"discussions": {
  "type": "relation",
  "relation": "one-to-many",
  "target": "api::discussion.discussion",
  "mappedBy": "author"
}

```

## isOwner policy 
**By default, all strapi api do not have the isOwnerpolicy** - meaning a get call with an authenticated user will find all the in the database even those that are not created by the owner. 

This will cause a problem for content restricted policy where you want to sandbox content to the userId and explicitly allowed by the user. So you need to implement your customised isOwner policy and isShared policy expicitly. restricting to FindOne do  nto solve the problem. Super important.


Guide to implement isOwner policy

Performance Tips

Always filter at the database level, not in JavaScript
Use indexes on foreign keys (Strapi usually does this automatically)
Use select/populate sparingly - only fetch needed fields
For one-to-one, consider using the user ID as the primary key
Monitor slow queries with database query logs

The key insight: The middleware isn't searching through all records - it's using indexed database queries that are very efficient. The real optimization is ensuring filters are applied at the database level, not in application code!
